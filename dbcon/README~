Macro to perform coincidences studies (Catania code: F. Riggi and P. La Rocca)

Input: a daily DST file for two telescopes
Ouput: a ROOT file with a TREE

config_correlation_EEE.txt
contains the setting:

 Telescope 1
 Telescope 2
 date
 $path where the input files are suppose to be ($path/$Telescope/date/*_dst.root)

The macro can be simply run in this way
root correlation_EEE.C

Alternativelly, if you are running at CNAF, you can compile the macro which automatically run on all the runs of a day
To compile run:
./compileClass
or
compileClass3
for tripple coincidences (config file should be as config_correlation_EEE3.txt)

Once compiled you can run
./analisiCoincAtCnaf.exe -d 2015-04-03 -s BOLO-01 BOLO-03 -p /recon
[add the info you want to pass from command line using option: -d (date), -s (2 schools) or -p (path)]
or
./analisiCoincAtCnaf3.exe 2015-03-12
[add the date if you want to replace the one in the config file, to be replaced as in the two coindicences case]



Also macro for autocorrelation was added to perform analysis in a single telescope looking at correlation of different triggered events.
The same config file as for the two coindences studies should be used

To merge more files before to run doCoinc.C the macro DoMerge.C can be used:
1) let prepare a list (filename->lista) of files you want to merge (i.e. ls BOLO-01-BOLO-04* >lista)
2) run: root -b -q -l DoMerge.C
3) rename the file outputMerge.root
